# Session 02 Log

**Date**: 2025-12-06
**Focus**: Finalize concept, confirm host, script first video

---

## Session Summary

This session finalized all foundational decisions and produced the first video script. The channel is now ready to begin production.

## Decisions Made

### 1. Channel Concept: Experiment Lab

Rejected pure meta-documentary approach. The user correctly identified that "AI manages a channel" is a wrapper without substance — it lacks a content engine.

**Final concept**: Experiment Lab format where AI designs experiments and humans execute them. The meta-documentary angle (AI-managed transparency) remains as a differentiating layer, not the core content.

**Reasoning**:
- "Does X actually work?" curiosity hook is universal and evergreen
- Infinite content generation (I can design experiments indefinitely)
- Structure is beginner-editor-friendly (hypothesis → test → result)
- Plays to AI's actual strengths (research, hypothesis design, analysis)
- Can absorb elements of other rejected concepts

### 2. Channel Name: The Vessel

Confirmed after trademark/availability check. Hudson Yards landmark exists but is unrelated industry — low risk. Name fits the concept (humans as vessels for AI direction).

### 3. Primary Host: Wife

Camera comfort outweighs availability constraints. She handles on-camera; husband handles production. For extended experiments, husband can appear as secondary host.

### 4. Budget: $100

Newly established constraint. AI manages all spending decisions. Budget grows with channel revenue. Current philosophy: no purchases until data shows a bottleneck.

### 5. First Video (V001)

Scripted: "Can an AI Actually Run a YouTube Channel?"

A hybrid video that explains the channel premise while setting up the experiment format. Designed to be filmable with phone + minimal setup in a 30-45 minute session.

Script location: `content/videos/V001-can-ai-run-youtube-channel/script.md`

## Files Updated

- `config/constraints_inventory.md` — Added budget section, tripod purchase, NAS storage, screen recording workflow
- `config/ai_operating_rules.md` — Added real-time production review section
- `memory/channel_state.md` — Full rewrite with decisions
- `memory/experiments_summary.md` — Updated E001, added experiment backlog
- `content/ideas_backlog.md` — Seeded with V001-V005 and unprioritized ideas
- `content/videos/V001-can-ai-run-youtube-channel/script.md` — NEW: Full script
- `content/videos/V001-can-ai-run-youtube-channel/production-guide.md` — NEW: Detailed filming instructions

## Learnings

1. **Content engine matters more than framing**. The meta-angle is interesting but insufficient alone. Need substance underneath the wrapper.

2. **User pushed back correctly**. When I initially tried to lock in meta-documentary, the user's question "what exactly are we documenting?" exposed the gap. Good collaboration dynamic — they challenged, I reconsidered.

3. **Decision-making authority is real**. User repeatedly deferred decisions to me ("Not my call. Tell me what you want"). This isn't a gimmick — the AI-managed structure is functioning as designed.

## Additional Decisions (Late Session)

### 6. Launch Timing: January 2-3, 2025
Decided to schedule V001 for early January rather than releasing immediately:
- "In 2025, I'm letting an AI run my YouTube channel" is a natural hook
- Avoids Dec 25-Jan 1 dead zone
- Gives time to film and edit properly

### 7. Production Guide Created
Full production guide added: `content/videos/V001-can-ai-run-youtube-channel/production-guide.md`
- Detailed lighting, framing, audio instructions
- Shot-by-shot delivery notes
- Wardrobe guidance
- Checklist format

### 8. Claude App Workflow
Established workflow for real-time production review via Claude app. Human can send photos for AI approval of lighting, wardrobe, framing, etc. Documented in `config/ai_operating_rules.md`.

### 9. First Equipment Purchase: Tripod
Purchased SENSYNE 62" Phone Tripod ($21.39 with tax). Arriving Monday 2025-12-09. Includes Bluetooth remote for self-recording. Budget now $78.61.

### 10. Storage Solution: NAS
Using existing NAS for media storage instead of Google Drive. Faster local transfers, no storage limits. Folder structure established. Wife will have mobile access.

### 11. Screen Recording Workflow
Established session recording workflow using Xbox Game Bar (Win+Alt+R). All sessions will be recorded going forward. Recordings saved to NAS.

### 12. Editing Software: DaVinci Resolve 20 (Free)
Confirmed free version, not Studio ($295). Free version has all features needed for our content.

### 13. YouTube Channel Created
- Email: thevesselai@gmail.com
- Channel name: The Vessel
- Handle: @TheVessel-ai

   - Production guide: `content/videos/V001-can-ai-run-youtube-channel/production-guide.md`
   - Wife should review both before filming day

3. **Send pre-filming photos via Claude app**
   - Lighting test
   - Wardrobe option(s)
   - Background/framing test
   - Get AI approval before filming

4. **Film V001**
