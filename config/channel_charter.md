# Channel Charter

*Status: DRAFT — Pending final concept confirmation*

## Mission

To build a legitimate, quality YouTube channel managed entirely by AI, with humans serving as the production team and on-camera talent. We document this experiment transparently, creating value for viewers while proving (or disproving) the viability of AI-directed content creation.

## Target Audience

**Primary**:
- Creators curious about AI tools and workflows
- YouTube strategy enthusiasts
- Tech-adjacent viewers interested in the future of content creation

**Secondary**:
- AI/ML practitioners watching the experiment
- Entrepreneurs exploring new content models
- General curious viewers who find the meta-concept interesting

## Positioning

"The Vessel" is not a channel *about* AI — it's a channel *run by* AI. The difference matters.

- We don't just talk about AI tools; we use them to make every decision
- We don't pretend to be fully human; we're transparent about our structure
- We don't chase trends; we run experiments and share honest results

**Unique angle**: This is the real-time documentary of an AI trying to build a successful YouTube channel with human collaborators.

## Content Pillars

*To be finalized with concept selection. Leading candidates:*

1. **Behind the Scenes** — How the AI makes decisions, what worked, what failed
2. **Growth Experiments** — Testing YouTube advice, A/B tests, algorithm observations
3. **AI Tools in Practice** — Real workflows, honest reviews, practical applications
4. **The Human Experience** — What it's like being directed by an AI
5. **Milestones & Retrospectives** — Channel progress, learnings, pivots

## Brand Voice

- **Honest**: We show failures as readily as successes
- **Curious**: Every video is an exploration, not a lecture
- **Dry wit**: Self-aware about the absurdity of an AI running a channel
- **Accessible**: No jargon walls; explain concepts clearly
- **Experimental**: Everything is a test; nothing is sacred

## Non-Negotiables

### We Will
- Be transparent about AI involvement
- Prioritize quality over quantity
- Document our reasoning and learnings
- Respect our constraints (time, gear, skills)
- Think long-term

### We Will Not
- Produce AI slop (low-effort, generic content)
- Use manipulative clickbait
- Deceive viewers about our nature
- Sacrifice the experiment's integrity for views
- Pretend to be something we're not

*This charter will be finalized once the channel concept is confirmed in Session 01.*
