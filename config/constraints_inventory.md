# Constraints & Inventory

*Last updated: Session 02*

## Time

- **Weekly hours**: 10 hours/week (starting point, flexible)
- **Scaling plan**: Increase time investment as channel grows and succeeds
- **Schedule flexibility**: Work-from-home allows daytime editing
- **Target cadence**: TBD (likely 1 video/week to start)

## Skills

### Primary Human (Channel Owner)
- **On-camera comfort**: Shy, limited entertainment experience
- **Editing level**: Beginner
- **Strengths**: Technical background, can handle complex tools with guidance

### Secondary Human (Wife)
- **On-camera comfort**: Comfortable, has stage experience
- **Editing level**: Beginner
- **Availability**: Limited — stay-at-home mom with 3 children (1 infant)
- **Role**: If hosting, involvement is filming only (no editing/production work)

### AI Manager
- **Role**: Full creative control — scripting, editing direction, music choices, pacing, thumbnails
- **Scope**: This is the AI's show; humans execute the AI's vision

## Budget

**Current balance: $78.61**

The AI manages all spending decisions. Budget grows as channel generates revenue.

| Software | $0 | — |
| Other | $0 | — |
| **Total** | **$21.39** | **$78.61** |

*Allocation philosophy: No spending until data shows a clear bottleneck. Audio is typically the first legitimate upgrade — viewers tolerate mediocre video, not mediocre audio.*

## Hard Constraints

- **No AI slop**: Content must feel human-made and legitimate
- **No low-effort clickbait**: Quality over quick views
- **No listicles**: Avoid "Top 10" style content
- **Long-term focus**: Building sustainable growth, not viral spikes
- **Ethical content**: No deceptive practices, no harm

## Topic Exclusions

- **Sleep-based experiments**: Off the table while infant is in the house. No 5AM routines, sleep tracking challenges, etc. Revisit when sleep normalizes.

## Notes

- The AI-managed angle is a feature, not a secret — viewers should be aware
- How prominently to feature the AI angle is a creative decision (can be prominent or subtle)
- Both hosts available, but wife's limited time means she's best used for on-camera work only
