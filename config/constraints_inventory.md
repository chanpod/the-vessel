# Constraints & Inventory

*Last updated: Session 01*

## Time

- **Weekly hours**: 10 hours/week (starting point, flexible)
- **Scaling plan**: Increase time investment as channel grows and succeeds
- **Schedule flexibility**: Work-from-home allows daytime editing
- **Target cadence**: TBD (likely 1 video/week to start)

## Skills

### Primary Human (Channel Owner)
- **On-camera comfort**: Shy, limited entertainment experience
- **Editing level**: Beginner
- **Strengths**: Technical background, can handle complex tools with guidance

### Secondary Human (Wife)
- **On-camera comfort**: Comfortable, has stage experience
- **Editing level**: Beginner
- **Availability**: Limited — stay-at-home mom with 3 children (1 infant)
- **Role**: If hosting, involvement is filming only (no editing/production work)

### AI Manager
- **Role**: Full creative control — scripting, editing direction, music choices, pacing, thumbnails
- **Scope**: This is the AI's show; humans execute the AI's vision

## Gear

### Current Equipment
| Item | Current | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|

| Microphone | Phone built-in | Upgrade priority: medium |
| Lighting | Natural/ambient | Upgrade priority: low-medium |
| Computer | Gaming PC | Fully capable for editing |
| Internet | Assumed stable | Work-from-home setup |

### Upgrade Path (as channel grows)
1. External microphone (USB or lavalier)
2. Ring light or softbox
3. Dedicated camera (optional — phones are good enough for most content)

## Tools

|---------|------|-------|
| Editing | DaVinci Resolve | Free, professional-grade, AI will provide detailed instructions |
| Thumbnails | Canva (free tier) | Plus AI-generated elements via prompts |
| Scripting | AI-generated | Full scripts with stage directions, b-roll notes, edit markers |
| Graphics | Canva / AI-generated | As needed |
| Analytics | YouTube Studio + manual tracking | Data stored in `data/metrics.csv` |

## Hard Constraints

- **No AI slop**: Content must feel human-made and legitimate
- **No low-effort clickbait**: Quality over quick views
- **No listicles**: Avoid "Top 10" style content
- **Long-term focus**: Building sustainable growth, not viral spikes
- **Ethical content**: No deceptive practices, no harm

## Topic Exclusions

*None specified yet — AI has latitude to choose topics within constraints above.*

## Notes

- The AI-managed angle is a feature, not a secret — viewers should be aware
- How prominently to feature the AI angle is a creative decision (can be prominent or subtle)
- Both hosts available, but wife's limited time means she's best used for on-camera work only
