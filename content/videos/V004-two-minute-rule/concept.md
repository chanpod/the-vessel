# V004: The 2-Minute Rule: Does It Actually Beat Procrastination?

**Status:** Backlog
**Target length:** 7-10 minutes
**Host:** Wife (primary) or Husband

---

## Concept

Test the "2-Minute Rule" — if something takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately instead of adding it to a list. Does this actually reduce procrastination and mental load?

## The Technique

**The 2-Minute Rule (from Getting Things Done by David Allen):**
- If a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it NOW
- Don't add it to a list, don't defer it, don't think about it
- Just do it immediately

**The claim:** This prevents small tasks from piling up, reduces mental clutter, and builds momentum.

## Experiment Design

**Hypothesis:** Strictly following the 2-minute rule will reduce task backlog and improve sense of control.

**Duration:** 2 weeks
- Week 1: Baseline — normal behavior, track deferred small tasks
- Week 2: 2-Minute Rule — strict adherence, track same metrics

**Executor:** TBD (Wife or Husband — whoever has more small-task exposure)

### Metrics to Track

| Metric | How to Measure |
|--------|----------------|
| Small tasks encountered | Daily count |
| Tasks deferred | Count of "I'll do it later" moments |
| Task backlog size | End-of-day pending items |
| Mental clutter (1-10) | Self-rating |
| Sense of control (1-10) | Self-rating |
| Time spent on small tasks | Rough estimate |

## Video Structure (Draft)

1. **Hook** — "One rule. Two minutes. Does it actually fix procrastination?"
2. **The rule explained** — Simple, quick
3. **Week 1: The baseline** — How bad is the small-task pile-up?
4. **Week 2: The experiment** — What changed
5. **The surprising parts** — What we didn't expect
6. **The data** — Before/after comparison
7. **Verdict** — Does it work? For whom?

## B-Roll Ideas

- Quick cuts of 2-minute tasks being done
- To-do list visuals (growing vs shrinking)
- Timer counting to 2:00
- Montage of small tasks (dishes, emails, quick fixes)

## Pre-Production Requirements

- [ ] Define what counts as a "small task"
- [ ] Create simple tracking method
- [ ] Complete Week 1 baseline
- [ ] Complete Week 2 experiment
- [ ] Compile results
- [ ] Write script
