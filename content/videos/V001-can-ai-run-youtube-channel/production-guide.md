## Pre-Production Checklist

### Before Filming Day

- [ ] Wife has reviewed the script and is comfortable with it
- [ ] Filming location scouted (see Location section below)
- [ ] Phone fully charged
- [ ] Phone storage cleared (need ~5-10 GB free)
- [ ] Kids' care arranged for 45-60 min uninterrupted filming window

### Equipment Needed

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Phone | Main camera. Use rear camera, not selfie cam (better quality) |
| SENSYNE 62" Tripod | Arriving Monday 2025-12-09. Adjust to eye level. Use Bluetooth remote. |
| Ring light OR window | Natural light from window is preferred if available |

---

## Location Setup

### Finding the Right Spot

Look for a location with:
1. **Clean background** — No clutter, no distracting items. A plain wall, bookshelf, or simple room corner works.
2. **Natural light source** — A window to the side of the frame (not behind the subject)
3. **Quiet** — No HVAC noise, no outside traffic, kids in another part of house

### Ideal Setup Diagram

```

### Background Options (in order of preference)

1. **Plain wall** — Solid color, no decorations. Simple and clean.
2. **Bookshelf** — Adds visual interest without distraction. Make sure it's tidy.
3. **Living space corner** — Can work if uncluttered. Avoid visible TVs, mirrors, or busy patterns.

**Avoid:**
- Windows directly behind subject (creates silhouette)
- Ceiling fans or lights in frame
- Mirrors (can show camera/crew)
- Cluttered spaces

## Camera Setup

### Phone Settings

1. **Resolution**: Set to highest available (4K if possible, 1080p minimum)
2. **Frame rate**: 30fps (standard for talking head)
3. **Orientation**: LANDSCAPE (horizontal), not portrait
4. **Focus**: Tap on wife's face to lock focus before each take
5. **Exposure**: Tap and hold to lock exposure if lighting is consistent

### Framing

```
+----------------------------------+
|                                  |
|         (headroom - small)       |
|          +-----------+           |
|          |           |           |
|          |   HEAD    |           |
|          |           |           |
|          +-----------+           |
|          |  CHEST/   |           |
|          | SHOULDERS |           |
|          +-----------+           |
|                                  |
+----------------------------------+

- Frame from mid-chest up
- Small amount of headroom (don't cut off top of head)
- Subject centered or slightly off-center (either works)
- Eyes should be roughly in upper third of frame
```

### Distance

- Phone should be approximately 3-4 feet from subject
- Close enough to capture facial expressions
- Far enough that it doesn't feel claustrophobic

---

## Lighting

### Natural Light (Preferred)

**Best scenario**: Window to the LEFT or RIGHT of the subject, camera facing subject.

- Time of day: Overcast days are best (soft, even light). Direct sunlight can be harsh.
- If sunny: Use sheer curtains to diffuse, or wait for clouds
- Avoid: Window directly behind subject, window directly in front of subject

### No Good Natural Light?

If filming at night or in a windowless room:
- Turn on all room lights
- Position any lamps you have to illuminate wife's face from the front/side
- Avoid overhead-only lighting (creates shadows under eyes)

### Lighting Check

Before filming, take a test photo and check:
- [ ] Face is evenly lit (no harsh shadows on one side)
- [ ] No dark shadows under eyes or nose
- [ ] Background isn't brighter than subject
- [ ] Colors look natural (not too orange or blue)

**Send me a test photo via the Claude app before filming. I'll confirm the lighting works.**

---

## Audio

### Phone Audio Tips

Phone built-in mics are acceptable for V001. To maximize quality:

1. **Quiet environment** — Turn off HVAC if possible during takes. Close windows.
2. **No echo** — Rooms with carpet, curtains, furniture absorb sound. Avoid empty rooms with hard floors.
3. **Distance** — Phone should be 3-4 feet away, not across the room
4. **Test recording** — Record 10 seconds, play back, listen for:
   - Background hum or buzz
   - Echo/reverb
   - Clarity of voice

### Audio Check

Before filming, record a test and verify:
- [ ] Voice is clear and understandable
- [ ] No distracting background noise
- [ ] No echo or hollow sound

---

## Wardrobe

### What Wife Should Wear

**Do:**
- Solid colors (no patterns)
- Colors that contrast with background (if white wall, don't wear white)
- Something she's comfortable in
- Fitted but not tight (loose clothing can look sloppy on camera)

**Avoid:**
- Stripes or small patterns (can create visual distortion called "moiré")
- Bright white (can blow out on camera)
- Logos or text (distracting, potential copyright issues)
- Noisy jewelry (bracelets that clank, dangly earrings)

**Good options:**
- Solid blue, green, burgundy, gray, black
- Simple neckline
- Whatever makes her feel confident

**Send me a wardrobe photo via Claude app. I'll confirm it works on camera.**

## Filming Process

### Shooting Order

Film in this order (not script order — this minimizes setup changes):

1. **All talking head footage first** — Wife delivers all dialogue sections
2. **B-roll second** — You capture screen recordings and supplemental shots

### Talking Head Filming

#### Setup Ritual (Do This Before Every Take)

1. Phone recording: START
2. Wife: Clap once (sync marker for audio if needed)
3. You: Call out the section ("Cold Open, Take 1")
4. 3-second pause
5. Wife: Deliver the lines
6. 3-second pause after finishing
7. Phone recording: STOP

#### Section-by-Section Instructions

**COLD OPEN [Script lines 1-10]**

*Lines:*
> "An AI is running this YouTube channel. I'm not talking about AI-generated voices or scripts that a human approves. I mean an actual AI is making the creative decisions. What videos to make. What I say. How to edit them. I'm just... the vessel. And this video? The AI wrote it."

*Delivery notes:*
- Start with direct eye contact to camera (lens, not screen)
- Tone: Confident, slightly intrigued, like sharing a secret
- The pause before "the vessel" should feel intentional, not forgotten
- "And this video? The AI wrote it." — slight smile, like it's a little absurd
- Film 3-4 takes. Vary the energy slightly each time.

---

**THE EXPERIMENT [Script lines 12-30]**

*Lines:* See script.md, "THE EXPERIMENT" section

*Delivery notes:*
- More conversational than cold open
- She's explaining to a friend, not presenting
- When listing what AI decides (content, structure, editing, thumbnails) — can count on fingers or just speak naturally
- "Why would we do this?" — genuine question, slight head tilt works
- End of section has a slight smile on "Either way, it should be interesting"
- Film 2-3 takes

---

**HOW WE GOT HERE [Script lines 32-58]**

*Lines:* See script.md, "HOW WE GOT HERE" section

*Delivery notes:*
- This section has the most information — pacing matters
- "Let me show you how the AI actually thinks" — lean in slightly, like getting to the good part
- When mentioning constraints (10 hrs, $100, phone, etc.) — can tick off on fingers
- "Five different concepts" — hold up hand briefly
- Quoting the AI ("camera comfort matters more than availability") — can do air quotes or just emphasize vocally
- Gesture to self on "So here I am" — natural, not theatrical
- Film 2-3 takes

---

**WHAT'S COMING [Script lines 60-78]**

*Lines:* See script.md, "WHAT'S COMING" section

*Delivery notes:*
- Building energy — this is the "here's why you should care" section
- "Experiments. Real ones." — emphasis on "real"
- List of experiment types — can vary delivery (some excited, some curious)
- "$100 budget" line — slight eyebrow raise, acknowledging the constraint
- "Phone camera and free editing software. That's the experiment." — matter-of-fact, confident
- Film 2-3 takes

---

**THE ASK [Script lines 80-92]**

*Lines:* See script.md, "THE ASK" section

*Delivery notes:*
- Direct call to action — don't rush
- "The AI specifically told me to ask you this" — can look at phone/paper as if reading the instruction (adds authenticity)
- "Comment what experiments you want to see" — genuine invitation
- "I'll see you in the next experiment. Or — the AI will see you. I'll just be here." — playful, slight smile, good closing energy
- Film 2-3 takes

---

### Take Notes

After each take, make a quick note:
- Take number
- Good / OK / Bad
- Any specific issue (stumbled on word, noise interruption, etc.)

This helps during editing — I'll ask you which takes felt best.

---

## B-Roll Capture

After all talking head footage is done, capture these:

### Screen Recordings (You Do This)

Use screen recording software (Windows: Xbox Game Bar, or OBS free)

1. **Planning docs scroll** — Open `phase1_concepts.md`, slowly scroll through. 30-60 seconds.
2. **Constraints doc** — Open `constraints_inventory.md`, slowly scroll. 30 seconds.
3. **AI conversation** — If you have this chat saved/accessible, scroll through it showing the back-and-forth. 60 seconds.
4. **Ideas backlog** — Open `ideas_backlog.md`, scroll through. 30 seconds.

### Physical B-Roll (Optional but Nice)

- Hands typing on keyboard
- Phone on tripod (the filming setup itself)
- Over-shoulder shot of editing software (can capture later during actual edit)

---

## Post-Filming

### File Organization

Create a folder structure:
```
V001-footage/
  talking-head/
    cold-open-take1.mp4
    cold-open-take2.mp4
    ...
  b-roll/
    screen-recording-concepts.mp4
    screen-recording-constraints.mp4
    ...
  notes.txt  (your take notes)
```

### Send to AI (Next Session)

When ready, come back and tell me:
1. Filming complete
2. Which takes felt strongest for each section
3. Any issues or concerns
4. Wife's feedback on the process

I'll then provide detailed editing instructions.
