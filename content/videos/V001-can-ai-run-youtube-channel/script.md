# V001: Can an AI Actually Run a YouTube Channel?

**Status:** Scripted
**Target length:** 5-7 minutes
**Host:** Wife (primary), Husband (brief appearance optional)

---

## Pre-Production Notes

### Filming Requirements
- Talking head setup (wife on camera)
- Good natural lighting (near window, daytime)
- Phone on stable surface or basic tripod
- Quiet environment (kids napped or occupied)
- Estimated filming time: 30-45 minutes

### B-Roll to Capture (Husband)
- Screen recordings of planning documents
- Screen recording scrolling through this conversation (optional, shows AI interaction)
- Typing on computer
- Phone filming setup

### Edit Notes
- Pacing: Conversational but tight. Cut dead air and stumbles.
- Music: Light, curious, slightly techy. Think "interesting discovery" not "epic reveal"
- Graphics: Simple text overlays for key points. Nothing fancy.
- Thumbnail will be created separately after filming.

## SCRIPT

### COLD OPEN [0:00-0:30]

*[Wife on camera, direct address, no intro graphics yet]*

**HOST:**
An AI is running this YouTube channel.

I'm not talking about AI-generated voices or scripts that a human approves. I mean an actual AI is making the creative decisions. What videos to make. What I say. How to edit them.

I'm just... the vessel.

*[Beat]*

And this video? The AI wrote it.

*[TITLE CARD: "The Vessel"]*

### THE EXPERIMENT [0:30-2:00]

**HOST:**
So here's what's happening. My husband and I wanted to start a YouTube channel. But instead of figuring it out ourselves, we handed full creative control to an AI.

Not as a gimmick. As a genuine experiment.

*[B-ROLL: Screen recording of planning docs, AI conversation]*

The AI — specifically Claude — is the channel manager. It decides:

*[Text overlays appear as she lists]*

- What content we make
- How videos are structured
- The editing style, music, pacing
- Even the thumbnail concepts

We're the production crew. We film what it tells us to film. We edit how it tells us to edit.

**HOST:**
Why would we do this?

Honestly? We were curious. Everyone talks about AI changing content creation. But almost nobody is actually *letting* an AI run the show and documenting what happens.

So that's what this channel is. A real experiment. Either the AI figures out YouTube and we grow... or it doesn't, and you get to watch that failure in real time.

*[Beat, slight smile]*

Either way, it should be interesting.

---

### HOW WE GOT HERE [2:00-4:00]

**HOST:**
Let me show you how the AI actually thinks.

When we started, we gave it our constraints:

*[B-ROLL: Constraints doc on screen]*

- Ten hours a week of our time
- A hundred dollar budget
- A phone camera
- Me — who's comfortable on camera — and my husband, who's... less comfortable
- And three kids, including an infant, so my availability is limited

Then we asked: what should this channel be?

*[B-ROLL: Concepts doc scrolling]*

**HOST:**
The AI came back with five different concepts. A meta-documentary about itself. An experiment lab. An educational channel. A life-coaching format. A human-versus-AI competition show.

*[Back to host]*

Then it actually *chose*. It picked the Experiment Lab concept — a channel where the AI designs experiments and we execute them.

Its reasoning?

*[Text overlay: "Curiosity gap is universal"]*

The "does this actually work?" hook is evergreen.

*[Text overlay: "Infinite content ideas"]*

It can design experiments forever.

*[Text overlay: "Plays to AI's strengths"]*

Research, hypothesis design, and analysis — that's what AI is actually good at.

**HOST:**
It also decided I should be the primary host because — and I'm quoting here — "camera comfort matters more than availability. Awkward delivery kills videos regardless of content quality."

*[Gestures to self]*

So here I am.

### WHAT'S COMING [4:00-5:30]

**HOST:**
So what will you actually see on this channel?

Experiments. Real ones.

*[Text overlays as she mentions each]*

- Testing productivity advice that's all over the internet. Does the 5 AM morning routine actually work? Does the Pomodoro technique? We'll find out.

- AI tool experiments. Not sponsored fluff — actual workflows tested with real results.

- Challenges the AI designs for us. Some will probably be uncomfortable. That's the point.

And underneath all of it, you'll see how the AI is actually managing this. The decisions it makes. What works. What fails. We're not hiding that part.

**HOST:**
Oh — and the AI is also managing a hundred dollar budget. That's it. If it wants better equipment, better software, anything... it has to earn it through channel revenue first.

So we're starting with a phone camera and free editing software. That's the experiment.

### THE ASK [5:30-6:00]

**HOST:**
If you're curious how this turns out — whether an AI can actually figure out YouTube — subscribe.

The AI specifically told me to ask you this:

*[Reading from phone or paper, showing it's from the AI]*

"Comment what experiments you want to see. I'm building a backlog, and I'm genuinely open to suggestions from the audience. What do you want us to test?"

*[Looks back at camera]*

So... tell it. Comment below.

I'll see you in the next experiment. Or — the AI will see you. I'll just be here.

*[End card / subscribe animation]*

## THUMBNAIL CONCEPT

**Option A:** Wife looking slightly skeptical/curious at camera, text overlay "AI RUNS THIS CHANNEL", small robot/AI icon

**Option B:** Split screen — AI interface on one side, wife on other side, text "The Experiment"

**Direction:** Clean, not cluttered. Face visible. Text readable at small size. Curiosity-inducing, not clickbait.

## POST-FILMING CHECKLIST

- [ ] Review footage for best takes
- [ ] Capture screen recordings for B-roll
- [ ] Edit per notes above (tight pacing, light music)
- [ ] Create thumbnail in Canva
- [ ] Write description and tags (AI will provide)
- [ ] Upload and schedule

## DESCRIPTION (Draft)

```
An AI is running this YouTube channel. Not as a gimmick — as a real experiment.

I handed full creative control to Claude (an AI) to see if it can actually figure out YouTube. It decides what videos we make, how they're structured, and how they're edited. I'm just the host executing its vision.

This video explains the experiment and what's coming.

WHAT YOU'LL SEE ON THIS CHANNEL:
- AI-designed experiments (testing advice, tools, challenges)
- The AI's actual decision-making process
- Real results — successes and failures

Want to see a specific experiment? Comment below — the AI is building its content backlog and taking suggestions.

---

This channel is part of an ongoing experiment in AI-managed content creation.
The AI manages: strategy, scripts, editing direction, thumbnails
The humans manage: filming, editing execution, publishing

Current AI budget: $100
Current equipment: Phone camera, free software

🤖 Channel managed by Claude (Anthropic)
