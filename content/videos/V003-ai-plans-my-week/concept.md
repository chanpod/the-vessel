# V003: I Let an AI Plan My Entire Week

**Status:** Backlog
**Target length:** 10-15 minutes
**Host:** Husband (primary), Wife (reactions/commentary)

---

## Concept

Hand over complete weekly planning to the AI (Claude). Every task, every schedule block, every decision about how to spend time. Document what happens.

## The Experiment

**Setup:**
1. At start of week, provide AI with: goals, obligations, constraints, energy patterns
2. AI creates detailed daily schedules
3. Human follows the plan exactly for 7 days
4. Document friction, surprises, successes, failures

**Hypothesis:** AI-generated schedules will be more efficient but may miss human nuances (energy, motivation, unexpected needs).

**Duration:** 1 week of execution + follow-up reflection

**Executor:** Husband

## What AI Will Plan

- Work tasks and time blocks
- Breaks and meals
- Exercise/movement
- Family time allocations
- Personal tasks/errands
- Even leisure time

## What to Track

| Metric | How to Measure |
|--------|----------------|
| Plan adherence | % of scheduled items completed as planned |
| Deviations | Count and reason for each |
| Productivity feeling (1-10) | Daily self-rating |
| Stress level (1-10) | Daily self-rating |
| Tasks completed vs planned | Ratio |
| Unexpected events | How plan handled them |

## Video Structure (Draft)

1. **Hook** — "I gave an AI control of my entire week. Every hour. Every task."
2. **The setup** — What info I gave the AI, the rules
3. **The plan** — Show the AI-generated schedule (screen recording)
4. **Day-by-day highlights** — Montage with commentary
5. **What worked** — Surprising wins
6. **What didn't** — Friction points, failures
7. **The data** — How much did I actually follow?
8. **Would I do it again?** — Honest verdict

## B-Roll Ideas

- Screen recording of AI planning conversation
- Calendar/schedule views
- Time-lapse of following the schedule
- Reaction moments (frustration, surprise)
- End-of-day reflections (short clips)

## Pre-Production Requirements

- [ ] Define week's goals and constraints
- [ ] Have AI create the full week plan
- [ ] Execute the week (7 days)
- [ ] Daily video diary clips (30-60 sec each)
- [ ] Compile tracking data
- [ ] Write full script based on results
