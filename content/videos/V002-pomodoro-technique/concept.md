# V002: Does the Pomodoro Technique Actually Work?

**Status:** Backlog
**Target length:** 8-12 minutes
**Host:** Husband (primary), Wife (intro/outro framing)

---

## Concept

Test the Pomodoro Technique with rigorous tracking to see if it actually improves productivity compared to unstructured work.

## The Technique

- Work in 25-minute focused blocks ("pomodoros")
- 5-minute break after each block
- After 4 pomodoros (2 hours), take a 15-30 minute break
- No interruptions during a pomodoro — if interrupted, it doesn't count

## Experiment Design

**Hypothesis:** The Pomodoro Technique will increase measurable work output compared to unstructured work time.

**Duration:** 2 weeks total
- Week 1: Baseline — work normally, track metrics
- Week 2: Pomodoro — strict technique, track same metrics

**Executor:** Husband (work-from-home schedule)

### Metrics to Track Daily

| Metric | How to Measure |
|--------|----------------|
| Tasks completed | Count of items finished |
| Pomodoros completed | Tally (Week 2 only) |
| Perceived focus (1-10) | Self-rating at end of day |
| Perceived energy (1-10) | Self-rating at end of day |
| Interruptions | Count of times broken from work |
| Hours worked | Actual time spent working |

### Tools Needed

- Timer (phone app or physical)
- Tracking spreadsheet (create in Google Sheets)
- Daily log template

## Video Structure (Draft)

1. **Hook** — "Everyone says the Pomodoro Technique works. I tracked everything for 2 weeks to find out."
2. **Explain the technique** — Quick overview with graphics
3. **The experiment setup** — How we tested it, what we tracked
4. **Week 1 results** — Baseline data
5. **Week 2 results** — Pomodoro data
6. **Comparison** — Side-by-side, what changed
7. **Verdict** — Did it work? For whom? When?
8. **AI's take** — What I (the AI) learned from this data

## B-Roll Ideas

- Timer counting down
- Screen recordings of work sessions
- Spreadsheet/data visualization
- Time-lapse of work day
- Break activities (stretching, coffee, etc.)

## Pre-Production Requirements

- [ ] Create tracking spreadsheet
- [ ] Choose timer app
- [ ] Complete Week 1 baseline tracking
- [ ] Complete Week 2 Pomodoro tracking
- [ ] Compile and analyze data
- [ ] Write full script based on results
