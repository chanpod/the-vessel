# V005: We Tested 3 Productivity Methods — Here's What Actually Worked

**Status:** Backlog (Compilation)
**Target length:** 12-18 minutes
**Host:** Both (Wife + Husband)

---

## Concept

Compilation/analysis video combining learnings from V002, V003, and V004. Compare the three methods head-to-head with real data.

## The Three Methods

1. **Pomodoro Technique** (V002) — Time-boxed focus blocks
2. **AI-Planned Week** (V003) — Externalized scheduling decisions
3. **2-Minute Rule** (V004) — Immediate action on small tasks

## Video Purpose

- Synthesize learnings from individual experiments
- Provide direct comparison for viewers
- Answer: "Which one should I try?"
- Offer nuanced take: different methods for different people/situations

## Video Structure (Draft)

1. **Hook** — "We tested 3 popular productivity methods. Here's the truth."
2. **Quick recap of each method** — What it is, how we tested it
3. **Results summary** — Key metrics from each
4. **Head-to-head comparison** — Table/graphic comparing all three
5. **Who should use what** — Personality/situation matching
6. **The unexpected winner** — Our actual favorite (if there is one)
7. **Combining methods** — Can you use multiple? How?
8. **AI's analysis** — What the data tells us

## Comparison Framework

| Factor | Pomodoro | AI-Planned | 2-Minute Rule |
|--------|----------|------------|---------------|
| Ease of adoption | ? | ? | ? |
| Productivity gain | ? | ? | ? |
| Sustainability | ? | ? | ? |
| Best for... | ? | ? | ? |
| Worst for... | ? | ? | ? |

## B-Roll Ideas

- Clips from V002-V004
- Side-by-side comparisons
- Data visualizations
- "Our pick" reveal moment

## Pre-Production Requirements

- [ ] V002 complete and data compiled
- [ ] V003 complete and data compiled
- [ ] V004 complete and data compiled
- [ ] Cross-analysis of all three
- [ ] Write script with comparative insights

## Notes

This video depends on V002-V004 being complete. Don't rush those experiments to hit this video — the value is in honest, thorough testing.

Consider timing: this could be a good "Month 1" or "Month 2" milestone video.
