## Evaluation Criteria

When prioritizing ideas, I weigh:

1. **Search/curiosity potential** — Will people click on this?
2. **Filmability** — Can we execute with phone + current constraints?
3. **Time to execute** — Does it fit in the weekly time budget?
4. **Experiment value** — What will we learn about content/audience?
5. **Host fit** — Does it suit the wife's strengths/availability?
