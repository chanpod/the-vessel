# Ideas Backlog

*All video ideas, from raw concepts to published.*

## Status Key

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `backlog` | Idea captured, not yet prioritized |
| `selected` | Chosen for production |
| `scripted` | Script written |
| `filmed` | Footage captured |
| `editing` | In post-production |
| `published` | Live on YouTube |
| `dropped` | Decided not to pursue |

## Active Pipeline

| ID | Status | Working Title | Category | Effort | Notes |
|----|--------|---------------|----------|--------|-------|
| V001 | scripted | Can an AI Actually Run a YouTube Channel? | Meta/Launch | Medium | Pilot video. Script complete. |

---

## Prioritized Backlog

*Next videos to produce after V001. Ordered by priority.*

| ID | Status | Working Title | Category | Effort | AI Angle | Notes |
|----|--------|---------------|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| V002 | backlog | The 2-Minute Rule: Does It Actually Beat Procrastination? | Productivity | Low | AI designed experiment, assigned host, evaluates results. Behind-the-scenes segment showing the assignment. | Wife tests in chaos environment. 2 weeks: baseline vs. rule applied. |
| V003 | backlog | I Let an AI Plan My Entire Week | AI Tools | Medium | Strong but needs reframing — not "wow AI" but "extending AI management to daily life." | One week execution. Show friction, negotiations, adjustments. |
| V004 | backlog | Month 1 Retrospective: What the AI Learned | Meta | Medium | **Pure meta** — AI reflects on decisions, mistakes, course corrections. | Schedule after ~4 videos. Pulls from session logs. Highly aligned with new direction. |
| V005 | deferred | Does the Pomodoro Technique Actually Work? | Productivity | Low | Moderate — AI assigns and evaluates, but generic productivity framing. | DEFERRED — neither host fits. Revisit when conditions change. |
| V006 | backlog | We Tested 3 Productivity Methods — Here's What Actually Worked | Productivity | High | Compilation — AI synthesizes learnings across experiments. | After V002, V003, and one more method tested. |

## Ideas Backlog (Unprioritized)

*Raw ideas to potentially develop. Evaluated for AI management angle fit.*

### Strong AI Angle (prioritize these)

| Idea | Category | AI Angle | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| We tested 3 thumbnail styles — here's the data | Meta | AI directs creative choices, data validates/refutes | Need 3+ videos first |
| Short intro vs long intro — what performs better? | Meta | AI makes structural decisions, tests assumptions | A/B test across videos |
| I let AI choose what I eat for a week | AI Life | Extends "AI directing life" premise, shows friction | Fun, visual |
| AI-generated workout plan — did it work? | AI Life | Same — AI directs, human executes, we see results | Combines AI + fitness |

### Moderate AI Angle (may need reframing)

| Idea | Category | AI Angle | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| "Eat the Frog" method — tested | Productivity | AI prioritizes tasks, but generic framing | Could work if AI angle emphasized |
| Posting time experiment | Meta | AI decides posting strategy, tests hypothesis | Need baseline data first |
| Can AI actually write a good cover letter? | AI Tools | Direct AI capability test | Practical, high search intent |
| ChatGPT vs Claude vs Gemini comparison | AI Tools | Comparing AI tools — meta but commodity content | Risks becoming outdated |

### Weak AI Angle (consider dropping or major reframe)

| Idea | Category | Issue | Verdict |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| Digital detox for 7 days | Life | AI tells you to disconnect... ironic but thin angle | Drop or reframe significantly |
| Inbox Zero | Productivity | Generic productivity, no real AI management component | Drop |
| Cold showers for 30 days | Health/Life | Physical challenge, no AI angle whatsoever | Drop |
| "Fake it till you make it" | Advice Testing | Psychological, hard to measure, weak AI angle | Drop |
| "Just start" | Advice Testing | Generic advice testing | Drop |
| "Done is better than perfect" | Advice Testing | Same — no strong AI management hook | Drop |

### Moved to Prioritized Backlog

- ~~Month 1 retrospective — what the AI learned~~ → Now V004

## Deferred Ideas

| Idea | Reason | Revisit When |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 5AM Morning Routine (7 days) | Infant in house — sleep is already wrecked | Sleep normalizes |
| Cold showers for 30 days | Physical challenge while sleep-deprived = bad idea | After infant phase |

## Dropped Ideas

| Idea | Reason |
|------|--------|
| — | *None yet* |

## Evaluation Criteria

When prioritizing ideas, I weigh:

1. **AI Management Angle** — How does this showcase the AI management dynamic? (PRIMARY CRITERION post-Session 03)
2. **Search/curiosity potential** — Will people click on this?
3. **Filmability** — Can we execute with phone + current constraints?
4. **Time to execute** — Does it fit in the weekly time budget?
5. **Experiment value** — What will we learn about content/audience?
6. **Host fit** — Does it suit the wife's strengths/availability?

**Note (Session 03):** The channel is "AI Management Documentary with experiments as vehicle." Every video should foreground the AI management mechanics, not just present experiment results. Ideas with weak AI angles need reframing or should be dropped.
