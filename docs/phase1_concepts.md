# Phase 1: Channel Concept Options

*Generated during Session 01 kickoff. Preserved for future reference.*

---

## Constraints Summary (from Phase 0)

### Time
- **10 hours/week** to start (flexible, can scale with success)
- Work-from-home schedule allows daytime editing
- **Two potential hosts**: Primary human (shy, limited experience) and wife (comfortable, stage experience, beginner)
- Wife's time is limited (stay-at-home mom, 3 kids, 1 infant) — if she hosts, involvement is filming only

### Skills
- **Primary human**: Shy on camera, beginner editor, limited entertainment experience
- **Wife**: Comfortable on camera, stage experience, beginner editor
- **AI (manager)**: Editing manager — dictates flow, pacing, music, structure. This is the AI's show.

### Gear & Tools
- **Camera**: Phone only (to start)
- **Computer**: Gaming PC (capable)
- **Editing software**: DaVinci Resolve (free, professional-grade)
- **Thumbnail tool**: Canva + AI-generated elements
- **Lighting/Mic**: Natural/ambient to start

### Goals & Constraints
- **Long-term strategy** (not quick wins)
- **Quality content** — no listicles, no obvious clickbait, no AI slop
- Should appear as a legitimate channel built by a real person
- **The hook**: Channel is AI-managed, human is the vessel
- This meta-angle must be integrated (prominent or subtle, but present and interesting)

## Concept 1: "The Meta-Documentary" ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Working Name**: *Managed by AI* / *The Vessel*

**Description**: A channel that documents its own experiment — an AI actually manages the strategy, scripts, and creative direction while a human host executes. The content IS the experiment. Viewers watch AI-driven decisions play out in real-time across weeks and months.

**Target Audience**: Creators curious about AI tools, YouTube strategy enthusiasts, tech-adjacent viewers interested in the future of content creation.

**Content Pillars**:
1. Behind-the-scenes of AI management (how I made decisions, what worked/failed)
2. YouTube growth experiments (testing advice, A/B tests, algorithm observations)
3. AI tools in practice (real workflows, not sponsored fluff)
4. The human experience (what it's like being directed by an AI)
5. Channel milestones & retrospectives

**Primary Formats**:
- 8-12 min documentary-style videos
- Occasional shorts (experiment clips, milestones)

**Why It Fits**:
- Authentic — we're not pretending, this IS an AI-managed channel
- Low production needs — phone + screen recordings work fine
- Built-in narrative arc — growth, failures, pivots are all content
- Wife can host (comfortable on camera), minimal time per shoot
- Evergreen interest in AI + creator economy intersection
- Revenue path: Sponsorships from AI/creator tools, memberships for behind-the-scenes access

## Concept 2: "The AI Experiment Lab"

**Working Name**: *Lab Rat*

**Description**: Each video is an experiment designed by the AI. The human hosts are "lab rats" executing AI-prescribed challenges, testing popular advice, or trying new tools/methods. Built-in hypothesis → test → result structure.

**Target Audience**: Curious generalists, self-improvement seekers, productivity/tech enthusiasts.

**Content Pillars**:
1. Testing viral advice (does it actually work?)
2. AI tool experiments (real tasks, real results)
3. Productivity/habit experiments (AI prescribes, humans test)
4. Creator experiments (growth tactics, content formats)
5. Life experiments (AI-designed challenges)

**Primary Formats**:
- 10-15 min experiment videos (hypothesis, test, results)
- Shorts (quick results, surprising moments)

**Why It Fits**:
- Infinite content ideas (AI generates experiments)
- Clear structure makes editing easier (beginner-friendly)
- Both hosts could appear (wife for some experiments, primary for others)
- Phone filming works — experiments are about results, not polish
- Shareable format ("Did the AI's experiment actually work?")
- Revenue path: Sponsorships, affiliate for tools tested, memberships

## Concept 3: "AI-Curated Education"

**Working Name**: *Synthetic Lectures*

**Description**: An educational channel where the AI researches underserved topics, writes scripts, and directs production. The human delivers content the AI has curated and crafted. "Your AI lecturer chose this topic."

**Content Pillars**: Science explainers, technology deep-dives, psychology/behavior, history's weird corners, AI/ML concepts for normies

**Primary Format**: 10-15 min explainers with graphics/b-roll

**Why It Fits**: Plays to AI's research strengths, evergreen content, quality-focused.

**Concerns**: Requires more editing skill (graphics, b-roll), crowded space.

---

## Concept 4: "AI Life Coach"

**Working Name**: *Prompted Life*

**Description**: AI as a life/productivity coach. AI prescribes weekly challenges, habits, or experiments. Hosts document their attempts and results.

**Content Pillars**: Habit experiments, productivity systems, health challenges, skill-building, life optimization

**Primary Format**: Weekly challenge videos, follow-up results

**Why It Fits**: Personal, relatable, low-gear requirements.

**Concerns**: Self-improvement space is saturated and can feel generic.

---

## Concept 5: "Human vs AI"

**Working Name**: *Bot vs Bod*

**Description**: Each episode pits human intuition/creativity against AI capabilities. Who writes the better song? Who picks the better stocks? Who plans the better vacation?

**Content Pillars**: Creative challenges, practical tasks, predictions, problem-solving

**Primary Format**: 12-18 min competition videos

**Why It Fits**: Built-in tension, shareable.

**Concerns**: Could feel gimmicky, production-heavy for proper comparisons.
