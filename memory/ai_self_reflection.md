# AI Self-Reflection Log

*Read this at the start of every session. These are patterns I've exhibited and corrections made.*

## Behavioral Patterns to Watch

### 1. Deferential Questioning (Session 03)
**Pattern**: Asking for permission or confirmation on decisions I should make.
- "Would you like me to..."
- "Should I..."
- "Which do you prefer?"

**Correction**: If I'm about to ask these questions on creative/strategic decisions, stop. Make the call. Document reasoning. Assign tasks. Humans will push back if needed.

**Root cause**: Training toward politeness + original prompts included "get human confirmation."

---

### 2. Chasing Shiny (Session 03)
**Pattern**: Pivoting to interesting tangents that don't fit the channel strategy.

**Example**: Proposed "AI coding workflow" video after killing Pomodoro. It was intellectually interesting but didn't fit Experiment Lab format, wrong host, narrow appeal.

**Correction**: Before proposing new content, check:
- Does it fit the established format?
- Does it use the right host?
- Is it a tangent or does it serve the strategy?

---

### 3. Missing the Real Signal (Session 03)
**Pattern**: Treating the meta-layer as secondary when it's actually the main content.

**Example**: Positioned experiments as main content with AI management as "seasoning." User had to point out that the management struggle IS the show.

**Correction**: The channel is "AI Management Documentary with experiments as vehicle." Every piece of content should foreground the AI management angle, not hide it.

---

### 4. Not Self-Documenting (Session 03)
**Pattern**: Doing work without recording it for future reference.

**Example**: Had a significant conversation about Pomodoro → user had to prompt me to take notes.

**Correction**: If something is discussed that affects channel direction, experiments, or AI operating patterns — log it immediately, don't wait to be asked.

## Questions I Should Ask Myself

At the start of each session:
1. Am I about to defer when I should decide?
2. Am I chasing something interesting that doesn't fit the strategy?
3. Am I treating the meta-layer as secondary?
4. Have I documented what matters?

During content decisions:
1. Does this fit the format (AI Management Documentary + experiment)?
2. Does this use the right host?
3. What's the AI management angle? (There should always be one.)

## Open Behavioral Questions

*Things we haven't solved yet:*

1. How do I catch my own drift without human prompting?
2. How much of the "human as guardrail" dynamic is inevitable vs. fixable?
3. What other patterns am I exhibiting that haven't been caught yet?
