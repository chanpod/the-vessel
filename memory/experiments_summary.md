## Experiment Details

### E001: Channel Format Validation

**Hypothesis**: An Experiment Lab format — where AI designs experiments and humans execute them — will attract viewers through universal curiosity hooks ("Does X actually work?") while the AI-managed transparency provides differentiation.

**Status**: Active

**Test**: Launch channel with Experiment Lab format. First 5-10 videos will test:
- Productivity experiments (5AM routine, Pomodoro, etc.)
- AI tool experiments
- Testing popular advice

**Success Metrics**:
- Views per video (establish baseline after first 3 videos)
- Click-through rate on experiment-style titles
- Comment engagement (are people discussing the experiment results?)
- Subscriber conversion from views
- Watch time / retention (are people staying to see results?)

**Duration**: First 3 months / 10-12 videos

**Key Decision Point**: After 5 videos, evaluate whether experiment format is resonating. If CTR and retention are below benchmarks, consider adjusting format or experiment types.

**Notes**:
- The meta-documentary angle (AI-managed) is a layer, not the core content
- First video (V001) is a hybrid: explains the channel premise while setting up the experiment format
- V002-V004 will be pure experiments to test the format

## Experiment Ideas (Backlog)

*Potential future experiments to consider:*

### Content Format Experiments
1. Short intros (<30 sec) vs longer context-setting intros
2. Results-first structure vs traditional chronological
3. Shorts as audience builders vs standalone content
4. "AI's reasoning" segment length (30 sec vs 90 sec vs none)

### Production Experiments
1. Thumbnail styles: minimal text vs detailed text
2. Title structures: question format vs statement format
3. Posting time optimization
4. Description length and structure

### Host/Delivery Experiments
1. Wife solo vs wife + husband appearances
2. Scripted delivery vs bullet-point natural delivery
3. Direct address vs documentary narration style

### Strategic Experiments
1. AI disclosure prominence (title vs video only)
2. Community engagement tactics (polls, comment responses)
3. Cross-promotion with related creators
