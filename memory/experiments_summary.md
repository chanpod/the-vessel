## Experiment Details

### E001: Channel Concept Validation

**Hypothesis**: A meta-documentary about an AI-managed YouTube channel will attract viewers interested in creators, AI, and the future of content — and differentiate us from generic AI content.

**Status**: Planned (pending concept confirmation)

**Test**: Launch channel with meta-documentary concept, publish first 5-10 videos, measure engagement.

**Success Metrics**:
- Views per video > TBD (set baseline after first 3 videos)
- Subscriber conversion rate from views
- Comment sentiment (are people engaging with the AI-managed angle?)
- Retention curves (are people watching to understand the experiment?)

**Duration**: First 3 months / 10-12 videos

**Notes**: This is our foundational experiment. Everything else builds on validating that this concept resonates.

## Experiment Ideas (Backlog)

*Potential future experiments to consider:*

1. Short intros (<30 sec) vs longer context-setting intros
2. Thumbnail styles: minimal text vs detailed text
3. Posting time optimization
4. Shorts as audience builders vs standalone content
5. AI disclosure in title vs only in video
6. Wife hosting vs channel owner hosting (for specific content types)
