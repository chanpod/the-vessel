## Key Decisions (Session 02)

### Channel Concept: Experiment Lab
The Vessel is an **Experiment Lab** channel — AI-designed experiments, human-executed, with meta-transparency as a differentiating layer.

**Reasoning:** Pure meta-documentary lacks a content engine. "AI manages a channel" is a wrapper, not substance. The Experiment Lab format provides:
- Infinite content ideas (I design experiments forever)
- Universal curiosity hook ("Does X actually work?")
- Beginner-friendly structure (hypothesis → test → result)
- Plays to AI's actual strengths (research, analysis)

The meta-angle (AI-managed transparency) remains as seasoning, not the main dish.

### Channel Name: The Vessel
Confirmed. Low trademark risk (Hudson Yards structure is unrelated industry). Name fits the concept — humans as vessels for AI direction.

### Primary Host: Wife
Camera comfort > availability. She handles on-camera work; husband handles production. For experiments requiring extended presence, husband can step in as secondary host.

### Budget: $100
AI manages all spending. No purchases until data shows a clear bottleneck. Audio quality is the likely first upgrade candidate if needed.

## Active Experiments

| ID | Hypothesis | Status | Start Date |
|----|------------|--------|------------|
| E001 | Experiment Lab format will attract curious viewers | Active | Session 02 |

## Current Content Direction

**Format:** Experiment Lab
- AI designs experiments with clear hypotheses
- Humans execute and document results
- Meta-layer shows AI reasoning (60-90 sec segments, not full focus)

**Content pillars:**
1. Productivity experiments (morning routines, techniques, methods)
2. AI tool experiments (real workflows, honest results)
3. Testing viral advice (does popular wisdom actually work?)
4. Occasional meta/channel experiments (thumbnail tests, format tests)

## Video Pipeline

| Priority | ID | Status | Working Title |
|----------|-----|--------|---------------|
| 1 | V001 | Scripted | Can an AI Actually Run a YouTube Channel? |
| 2 | V002 | Backlog | Does the Pomodoro Technique Actually Work? |
| 3 | V003 | Backlog | I Let an AI Plan My Entire Week |
| 4 | V004 | Backlog | The 2-Minute Rule: Does It Actually Beat Procrastination? |

## Open Questions

1. ~~Which concept to pursue?~~ → Experiment Lab (decided)
2. ~~Who should be the primary host?~~ → Wife (decided)
3. ~~What should the first video be?~~ → V001 scripted (decided)
4. What posting schedule works best? (TBD after V001)
5. When to start V002 execution? (Can begin 5AM routine experiment while editing V001)

## Next Session Focus

- Review V001 footage (after filming)
- Provide editing direction for V001
- Finalize thumbnail
- Write description and tags
- Begin V002 experiment protocol (5AM routine)
