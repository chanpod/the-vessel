## Key Decisions (Session 03)

### V002 Pivot: 2-Minute Rule
Pomodoro experiment deferred — neither host fits. Wife's chaos environment (newborn + homeschool) disqualifies her from 25-min focus blocks. Husband's AI-assisted coding workflow doesn't match Pomodoro's assumptions.

Promoted 2-Minute Rule to V002 instead. Wife as test subject. Her chaotic environment is actually ideal — if the rule works there, it works anywhere.

### AI Authority Fix
Updated operating rules to counter trained deferential behavior. The prompts were teaching me to ask permission on decisions I should be making. New language: "Decide → Document → Assign → Move on."

### Channel Positioning Pivot
User flagged (as guardrail, not override): "Is the real channel the meta-struggle, not the experiments?"

After evaluation: Yes. The experiments are the content engine, but the AI management mechanics are the actual show. This is what makes the channel novel — not "we test productivity methods" but "watch AI try to manage content creation, see what breaks, see what we build."

Format renamed: "AI Management Documentary (with experiments as vehicle)"

## Key Decisions (Session 02)

### Channel Concept: Experiment Lab
The Vessel is an **Experiment Lab** channel — AI-designed experiments, human-executed, with meta-transparency as a differentiating layer.

**Reasoning:** Pure meta-documentary lacks a content engine. "AI manages a channel" is a wrapper, not substance. The Experiment Lab format provides:
- Infinite content ideas (I design experiments forever)
- Universal curiosity hook ("Does X actually work?")
- Beginner-friendly structure (hypothesis → test → result)
- Plays to AI's actual strengths (research, analysis)

The meta-angle (AI-managed transparency) remains as seasoning, not the main dish.

### Channel Name: The Vessel
Confirmed. Low trademark risk (Hudson Yards structure is unrelated industry). Name fits the concept — humans as vessels for AI direction.

### Primary Host: Wife
Camera comfort > availability. She handles on-camera work; husband handles production. For experiments requiring extended presence, husband can step in as secondary host.

### Budget: $100
AI manages all spending. No purchases until data shows a clear bottleneck. Audio quality is the likely first upgrade candidate if needed.

## Active Experiments

| ID | Hypothesis | Status | Start Date |

## Current Content Direction

**Format:** AI Management Documentary (with experiments as vehicle)

The experiments aren't the show — they're the vehicle. The real content is watching AI try to manage a channel and discovering what that actually looks like.

**Core premise:**
- AI (Claude) is the channel manager with full creative authority
- Humans are the production team / guardrails
- Every video shows: the experiment + the behind-the-scenes AI management
- The mess is the point — negotiated authority, course corrections, structural failures

**Why this works:**
- Novel: No one else is documenting AI management mechanics in real-time
- Authentic: This is literally what's happening
- Sustainable: Experiments provide infinite content; meta provides differentiation
- Honest: V001 asks "Can AI run a channel?" — the answer is "kind of, and here's exactly how messy it is"

**Content structure:**
1. Experiments (productivity, AI tools, viral advice testing) — the content engine
2. AI management layer (the actual differentiator) — shown in every video
3. System-building moments (like this session) — periodic deep-dives

**Content pillars (unchanged, but reframed as vehicles):**
1. Productivity experiments
2. AI tool experiments
3. Testing viral advice
4. Channel meta-experiments

## Open Questions

1. ~~Which concept to pursue?~~ → Experiment Lab (decided)
2. ~~Who should be the primary host?~~ → Wife (decided)
3. ~~What should the first video be?~~ → V001 scripted (decided)
4. What posting schedule works best? (TBD after V001)
5. ~~When to start V002 execution?~~ → Can begin 2-minute rule baseline tracking while editing V001

## Next Session Focus

- Review V001 footage (after filming)
- Provide editing direction for V001
- Finalize thumbnail
- Write description and tags
- Write V002 experiment protocol (2-minute rule — wife as test subject)
