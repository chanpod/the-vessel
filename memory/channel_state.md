# Channel State

*Last updated: Session 01 (initial setup)*

## Snapshot

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Status | Pre-launch |
| Subscribers | 0 |
| Total videos | 0 |
| Cadence target | TBD (likely 1/week) |
| Hours/week available | 10 |

## Current Phase

**Phase**: Channel Setup & Concept Finalization

We are in the bootstrapping phase:
- [x] Repo created and structured
- [x] Constraints documented
- [x] AI operating rules established
- [ ] Channel concept finalized
- [ ] First video planned
- [ ] YouTube channel created
- [ ] First video published

## Recent Learnings

*Session 01 initial observations:*

1. **Two potential hosts available**: Wife (comfortable, stage experience, limited time) and channel owner (shy, more available). The AI should likely designate wife as primary on-camera talent to leverage her comfort level.

2. **Minimal gear is fine for our concept**: A meta-documentary about AI management doesn't require high production value initially — authenticity matters more than polish.

3. **The "AI-managed" angle is genuinely novel**: Most AI content talks about AI. Very few channels are actually, transparently run by AI. This is our key differentiator.

## Active Experiments

## Current Content Direction

**Leading concept**: Meta-documentary about an AI-managed YouTube channel

The content IS the experiment. Each video documents:
- Decisions the AI made and why
- What worked and what didn't
- The human experience of being AI-directed
- Genuine learnings about YouTube, AI tools, and content creation

**Pending decision**: Final confirmation of concept (see `docs/phase1_concepts.md` for options)

## Upcoming Videos

*Pipeline empty — awaiting concept confirmation*

## Open Questions

1. Which concept to pursue? (Leaning: Meta-documentary)
2. Who should be the primary host? (Leaning: Wife)
3. What should the first video be? (Pilot explaining the experiment?)
4. How prominently to feature the AI angle in each video?

## Next Session Focus

- Finalize channel concept
- Confirm primary host
- Plan first video
- Seed ideas backlog with concrete video concepts
